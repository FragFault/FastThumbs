## Overview
### Description
Game app that scores how fast users can type.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Gaming/Skill Learning
- **Mobile:** We want this application exclusively for mobile devices as our purpose is to improve users mobile texting skills. Functionality would not be limited to just mobile devices but on principal it is best to keep it mobile for the sake of being unique.
- **Story:** App helps build user mobile typing skills by giving timed prompts. Users can be competitive with one another with global leaderboards.
- **Market:** Our market is for those who want to improve mobile typing skills and competitive natured players.
- **Habit:** This app is encouraged to be used daily because of daily challenges and building skills incrementally.
- **Scope:**First we would start with our app determining how fast and accurate they can type. We would also give users the option to select from a competitive or casual game and view a leaderboard. Our app can expand into either having teams of players competing against other teams (like Clash of Clans) or allow users to create their own prompts/levels that other players can try.
